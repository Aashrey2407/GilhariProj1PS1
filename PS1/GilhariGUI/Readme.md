### The Gilhari Project's GUI

This graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed using the Java Swing framework. It features a set of filters that allow users to refine their queries and view results in a tabular format.

The application interacts with the Gilhari Microservice Framework via REST API calls to handle data processing and retrieval. Notably, there is no direct code for establishing connections with the relational database management system (RDBMS) or executing SQL queries; these operations are managed internally by the Gilhari framework developed by Software Tree.
